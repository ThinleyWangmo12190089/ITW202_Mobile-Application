        The cover of Anthology 1 is the first third of the Anthology collage made by Klaus
        Voormann and Alfons Kiefer. Various photographs and album covers are torn and
        collected together. Pete Bests face was torn away from the Savage Young Beatles
        record jacket in the centre of the album cover, revealing the face of his successor,
        Ringo Starr, below. The bottom leftmost photograph on the Anthology 1 cover does
        feature an unobscured Best.The missing portion of the photo was subsequently used
        on the cover of Bests 2008 album Haymans Green, an act described by one fan as
        "Pete Bests revenge".</string>
